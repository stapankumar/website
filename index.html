                <p class="about-intro">I like working on things that take time to understand.
                Problems where the first solution is rarely the correct one,
                and clarity comes only after digging deeper.</p>
                <p class="about-personal">Outside of work, I enjoy photography and visual storytelling, often drawn to imperfect but balanced compositions. 
                I like observing things quietly — revisiting ideas, frames, or thoughts until they feel right. 
                I also enjoy mathematics and explaining concepts to others, something I’ve often done at my university.</p>
